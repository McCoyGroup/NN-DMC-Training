# NN-DMC Training Template

This is a repository for the ongoing scripts we use to generate data nad train the neural networks for the NN-DMC workflow. These files will presmably change quite a bit as the project evolves, so we want to have a record of this. Also contains bash/sbatch scripts for running on Mox (STF-GPU), the UW supercomputer using McEnv, the group's general-purpose container.
